# DenisBrogniart

## General infos
Denis Brogniart is a multitasking discord bot.
Its goal is to manage the Koh Lanta Discord game as game master, without requiring a physical person dedicated to this role.
Thus, its missions are diverse: management of votes, results, fight against cheating, moderation, management of secret alliances, etc.

## Technologies
Project is created with:
* Python 3.10.11
* [Discord Dev Portal](https://discord.com/developers/)
* [MongoDb](https://mongodb.com)
* [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com)

## Setup
To run this project:
1. Download it
2. Setup a Python Virtual Environnement with the [requirements.txt file](/requirements.txt).
3. Create the Server [Discord architecture](#discord-server-architecture) as defined below.
4. Create the [roles](#discord-roles-architecture) as defined below.
5. Configure a discord bot on the [Discord Dev Portal](https://discord.com/developers/).
6. Create an empty database en [MongoDb](https://mongodb.com) and copy/create the connection url.
7. Complete the [.env](/EnvExample/.env) file with the unique ids and tokens specific to your server. Then move it to the root of the project.
8. Complete the discussion channels with templates from the [Templates](/Templates/) folder

[!WARNING]
Some functions, names and variables are written in French. You are free to change them to their English equivalent or any other language. Just be careful that the operation of the robot is not affected, especially in the channel names and roles.

## Discord server architecture
### The server must meet a certain architecture for the bot to function properly.

It should have the following list of chat channels, which can be placed however you like:
* votes : in which there will be the messages to vote
* results : in which there will be the results of the different votes
* registration: in which new players will be able to identify
* general: in which players can discuss
* eliminated: in which the eliminated can discuss
* bot: in which Denis Brogniart can send messages to admins

But also two categories:
* Help:
    * alliance-creation
    * alliance-add-a-member
    * alliance-remove-a-member
    * robot-schedules
    * robot-github

* Alliances:
    * This entire category is entirely controlled by Denis Brogniart, it is here that he will create the text and audio channels of the alliances and manage their access.

## Discord roles architecture
### The server roles must meet a certain architecture for the bot to function properly. It is imperative to respect the order of roles below.

1. Maitre du jeu (en: game master) only for the bot
2. Admin
3. Finaliste (en: finalist)
4. Joueur (en: player)
6. Votant Final (en: final voter)
7. Elimin√© (en: eliminated)

[!NOTE]
I do not share with you the configuration of each role. It's up to you to then configure the permissions so that access works correctly and according to your wishes.

[!WARNING]
The robot (and therefore the Game Master role) must have administrator rights.
