Create an alliance:

To do this, it is necessary to send a message to the said alliance group in the following form:
 
`/delete @player`

The expression "<@&ID_DU_ROLE_JOUEUR>" must be replaced by "@"+ the user concerned, the rest must be copied as is.
To replace the expression "<@&ID_DU_ROLE_PLAYER>", type @, possibly the first letters of the user name, and select the player you want to delete from the menu that opens.

Example: /remove <@ID_DE_L_ADMIN>
