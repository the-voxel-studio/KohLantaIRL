Create an alliance:

For this, it is necessary to send a message directly to the robot <@ID_DU_ROBOT> in private message in the following form:
 
`/alliance alliance-name`

The expression "name-of-the-alliance" is to be replaced by what you wish, the rest must be copied as is.
The replacing expression "alliance-name" cannot contain spaces or special characters other than "-".

It is imperative to communicate with the robot in private chat because otherwise, it will send a notification to all players announcing that you are creating an alliance and its name.

Example: `/alliance the-super-alliance`
